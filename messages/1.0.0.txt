=> 1.0.0

Breaking:

* Formatting on save (controlled by "lsp_format_on_save" setting) is no longer supported
  by this server. Instead, applying fixes is now handled by "code actions on save" feature,
  controlled by "lsp_code_actions_on_save" setting.

  Example LSP configuration that enables applying eslint fixes on save:

  "lsp_code_actions_on_save": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": true,
  },

  To enable the feature, open "Preferences: LSP Settings" from the Command Palette and
  set those settings.

Change:

* Enable for Typescript files by default.
  (Make sure to update your eslint configuration according to
   https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint)

Maintenance:

* Update eslint server to latest version
